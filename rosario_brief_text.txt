  BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTâ€™S AMENDED / RENEWED MOTION TO
DISMISS COUNT II (BAD FAITH) OF PLAINTIFFâ€™S COMPLAINT AND TO STRIKE
CERTAIN IMMATERIAL AND/OR IMPERTINENT ALLEGATIONS FROM COUNT I
                       (BREACH OF CONTRACT)

         Defendant, Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company submits this Brief in support of

its Amended Motions to Dismiss.

I.       STATEMENT OF RELEVANT FACTS

         Pursuant to Plaintiffâ€™s Complaint, this case arises from a motor vehicle accident that

occurred on or about January 12, 2024. (Doc. 1-5, Â¶ 3). Plaintiff, Nydia Rosario, alleges that she

sustained injuries and damages as a result of the accident. (Id., Â¶Â¶ 19-23). Plaintiff alleges that the

accident was caused by a driver who did not maintain sufficient liability insurance. (Id., Â¶ 13).

Therefore, Plaintiff made a claim for Underinsured Motorist (â€œUIMâ€?) coverage pursuant to an

automobile insurance policy issued by the Defendant, Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance

Company, (hereinafter â€œLiberty Mutualâ€? or â€œDefendantâ€?) (Id., Â¶Â¶ 10-13). The parties had not

settled or resolved the UIM claim prior to Plaintiff filing the instant Complaint.

II.      STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY

         Plaintiff initiated this action by filing a Complaint in the Philadelphia County Court of

Common Pleas on December 9, 2025. (Doc. 1-5). Plaintiff served Defendant with the Complaint

on December 19, 2025. Defendant timely removed the case to this court on January 16, 2026.

(Doc. 1).

         Defendant filed Motions to Dismiss Counts II (Bad Faith) and III (Unfair Trade Practices

and Consumer Protection Law) of Plaintiffâ€™s Complaint, and also to strike certain immaterial

and/or impertinent allegations from Count I. (Breach of Contract). (Doc. 9).

         After conferring with Plaintiffâ€™s counsel, Defendant filed Amended / Renewed Motions to

Dismiss Count II (Bad Faith) and also to strike certain immaterial and/or impertinent allegations

from Count I (Breach of Contract). This Brief is submitted in support of Defendantâ€™s Amended /

Renewed Motions.

III.     ARGUMENT

         A.         THE COURT SHOULD GRANT DEFENDANTâ€™S MOTION TO DISMISS
                    COUNT II (BAD FAITH), WITH PREJUDICE, BECAUSE PLAINTIFF
                    HAS FAILED TO ASSERT A VIABLE CAUSE OF ACTION FOR BAD
                    FAITH AND HAS OTHERWISE FAILED TO MEET THE PLEADING
                    REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 8.

1.       Standard of Review

         Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), this Court may dismiss Plaintiffâ€™s

Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).

A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the legal sufficiency of a complaint. In

deciding a motion to dismiss, the court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true,

â€œconstrue the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under

any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.â€? McTernan v. City

of York, 564 F.3d 636, 646 (3d. Cir. 2009) (citations omitted).

         Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 sets forth the mandatory pleading standard for

complaints filed in federal courts and provides, in relevant part, as follows:

                    (a)    Claim for Relief. A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain:

                           (1)     a short and plain statement of the grounds for the courtâ€™s
                                   jurisdiction, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim
                                   needs no new jurisdictional support;
                           (2)     a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is
                                   entitled to relief; and
                           (3)     a demand for the relief sought, which may include relief in the
                                   alternative or different types of relief.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a).

2.       Plaintiffâ€™s Complaint Contains No Allegations of Acts or Omissions to Support an
         Actionable Insurance Bad Faith Claim.

         With respect to the bad faith claim alleged in Count II of Plaintiffâ€™s Complaint, the

conclusory averments are insufficient to satisfy the pleading requirements set forth in Federal Rule

of Civil Procedure 8, specifically in light of Pennsylvania federal courtsâ€™ interpretation of pleading

requirements with regard to insurance bad faith allegations.

         The pivotal case on this issue is the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Ashcroft v.

Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). The Supreme Court provided the following relevant analysis of Rule

8(a)(2):

                    [T]he pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require â€˜detailed
                    factual allegationsâ€™ but it demands more than an unadorned, the
                    defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation. A pleading that offers
                    â€˜labels and conclusionsâ€™ or â€˜a formulaic recitation of the elements of
                    a cause of action will not do.â€™ Nor does a complaint suffice if it
                    tenders â€˜naked assertions[s]â€™ devoid of further factual enhancement.

Id. at 678 (citing Bell Atlantic Corp. V. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)) (internal citations

omitted and emphasis supplied).

         In order to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter

which, if accepted as true, states â€œa claim for relief that is plausible on its face.â€? Ashcroft, 556 U.S.

at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff pleads

factual averments that allow the court to draw reasonable inferences that the defendant is liable for

the alleged misconduct. Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). While the

plausibility standard is not equivalent to a â€œprobability requirement,â€? it requires more than a â€œsheer

possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.â€? Id. The mere recital of the elements of a cause

of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, does not meet the required pleading standard.

Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). Only a complaint that sets forth a

plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss. Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 679.

         Following the Ashcroft and Twombly decisions, Pennsylvaniaâ€™s federal trial courts have

consistently followed and applied a three-part analysis to determine whether allegations in a

complaint survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Kiessling v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co.,

2019 US. Dist. LEXIS 24085, at *5-6 (E.D. Pa. 2019). First, the court must consider the elements

a plaintiff is required to plead for a particular claim. Id. Second, it is the District Courtâ€™s

responsibility to identify all factual allegations that constitute nothing more than â€œlegal

conclusionsâ€? or â€œnaked assertions,â€? since such allegations are â€œnot entitled to the assumption of

truth and must be disregarded for purposes of resolving a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.â€? Id. Third,

the District Court must identify the well-pleaded, non-conclusory factual allegations, and

determine whether the complaint states a plausible claim for relief. Id.

         In the instant matter, Plaintiff has failed to meet the pleading requirements of Federal Rule

of Civil Procedure 8, with respect to Count II of her Complaint, requiring dismissal of that count

with prejudice. Plaintiff has not included a short and plain statement, or any factual statement,

sufficient to support a bad faith claim against Defendant. Plaintiff has not pled facts sufficient to

establish that, if proven, she would be entitled to relief. What Plaintiff has included is a pro forma

litany of the very unadorned, â€œdefendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusationsâ€? that the Supreme

Court rejected in Ashcroft, supra. In particular, Plaintiff has alleged in boilerplate and conclusory

fashion:

                                          COUNT II â€“ BAD FAITH

                    25. Plaintiff, Nydia Rosario, incorporates herein the allegations set forth
                    in the aforementioned paragraphs, inclusive, as if set forth below of
                    length.1

                    26. Defendant has acted, and continues to act, in bad faith,
                    pursuant to 42 Pa. C.S.A Section 8371, by breaching the duty of
                    good faith and fair dealing with respect to the insurance policy by
                    failing to make any offer or make payments for underinsured
                    motorist benefits covering Plaintiff.

                    27. The outrageous, intentional, reckless, malicious and/or
                    negligent acts and/or conduct of Defendant, by and through its
                    agent and/or employee, including but not limited to, Preston Kidd,
                    in making misrepresentations, in failing to make any offer and/or
                    failing to make any payments, constitutes bad faith and Defendant
                    should be liable for such conduct.

                    28. Due to injuries sustained in the instant motor vehicle accident,
                    Plaintiff is entitled recover to pain and suffering compensation far
                    exceeding any already-exhausted benefits of the third party, Edith
                    Brown, by and through AAA and Allstate.

                    29. Defendant, without reasonable cause, has failed to act in good
                    faith and fair dealing pertaining to the best interest of Plaintiff, an
                    insured of Defendant.




1
  The aforementioned paragraphs (Â¶Â¶ 1-24) contain general allegations regarding the parties, the accident, available
insurance coverage, plaintiffâ€™s alleged injuries and her claim for UIM coverage. These paragraphs do not include
any factual allegations that are sufficient to support the alleged bad faith claim plead in Count II.

                    30. Defendant has no reasonable justification in its failure to make
                    any offer and/or make any payments to Plaintiff under the
                    provisions of the said policy of insurance.

                    31. In fact, Defendant's agents, including, but not limited to, Dustin
                    Dodd, have made misrepresentations concerning the underinsured
                    motorist claim.

                    32. Defendant has acted, and continues to act, in bad faith by
                    breaching the duty of good faith and fair dealing with respect to
                    insurance policy and agreement in violation of 42 Pa. C.S.A.
                    Section 8371.

                    33. In relevant part, 42 Pa. C.S.A. Section 8371 provides as
                    follows:

                    In an action arising under an insurance policy, if the court finds
                    that the insurer has acted in bad faith toward the insured, the Court
                    may:

                    (1) Award interest on the amount of the claim from the date the
                    claim was made by the insured in an amount equal to the prime
                    rate of interest plus 3%;

                    (2) Award punitive damage against the insurer;

                    (3) Assess court costs and attorney's fees against the insurer.

Doc. 1-5, Â¶Â¶ 26-33.

         As set forth above, Plaintiffâ€™s bad faith count is based solely upon legal conclusions and

allegations and is devoid of facts to support those allegations. For example, while Plaintiff

generally alleges that Defendant made â€œmisrepresentationsâ€? (Id., Â¶Â¶ 27 and 31), she failed to

plead facts which identify the alleged misrepresentations or why she claims they were

misleading. Further, Plaintiffâ€™s Complaint does not even clarify whether Defendant made no

offer or, alternatively, made no payment. (Id., Â¶Â¶ 27 and 30).2

 During a meet and confer session, Plaintiffâ€™s counsel confirmed that a settlement offer was made and rejected
prior to suit being filed. Pennsylvania case law is clear that a mere dispute as to value, without more, does not
amount to bad faith. Brown v. Progressive Insurance Company, 860 A. 2d 493 (Pa. Super. 2004). Brown was

         Plaintiffâ€™s boilerplate and conclusory averments are not accompanied by factual allegations

sufficient to raise a plausible claim for alleged bad faith. Courts in this Circuit have routinely

dismissed bad faith claims with such â€œbare-bonesâ€? and conclusory allegations. See Smith v. State

Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 56 Fed. Appx. 133, 136 (3d. Cir. 2012); Rosenthal v. Am. States Ins. Co.,

2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50485, *14 (M.D. Pa. 2019); Moran v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 2019

U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24080, *13 (M.D. Pa. 2019); Clarke v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 2019 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 21507, *16 (M.D. Pa. 2019); McDonough v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 2019 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 19806, at *3 (E.D. Pa. 2019); Kosmalski v. Progressive Preferred Ins., 2018 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 74124, at *1 (E.D. Pa. 2018); Jones v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93673, at

*1 (E.D. Pa. 2017); Mozzo v. Progressive Ins. Co., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 159125, at *9-10 (E.D.

Pa. 2015); Atiyeh v. National Fire Ins. Co. of Hartford, 742 F. Supp. 2d 591 (E.D. Pa. 2010).

         In Jones v. Allstate Ins. Co., for example, the plaintiff sued his insurer for bad faith and

breach of contract following a disagreement between the parties as to the value of plaintiffâ€™s

underinsured motorist claim. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93673, at *1 (E.D. Pa. 2017). Jones alleged

that defendant had acted in bad faith by failing to:

                    (1)    act with reasonable promptness in evaluating and
                           responding to his claim and reasonable fairness in paying
                           the claim,

                    (2)    negotiate his claim,

                    (3)    properly investigate and evaluate his claim and


reaffirmed five years later in Johnson v. Progressive Ins. Co., 987 A. 2d 781 (Pa. Super. 2009), where the Court
reiterated its prior holdings that bad faith is not present merely because an insurer makes a low but reasonable
estimate of an insured's damages. In Johnson, the court explained, "The underlying facts [here] involve nothing
more than a normal dispute between an insured and insurer over the value of a UM claim. The scenario under
consideration occurs routinely in the processing of an insurance claim. To permit this action to proceed under these
facts would invite a floodgate of litigation any time an award is more than an insurer's offer to settleâ€¦â€?

                    (4)   request a defense medical examination of him.

Id. In that case, Judge Pappert dismissed the bad faith claim, holding that plaintiffâ€™s allegations

were insufficient to â€œraise the claim to a level of plausibility required to survive a Rule 12(b)(6)

motion to dismiss. Id. at *2-3.

         In McDonough v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., supra., the court also dismissed plaintiffâ€™s

statutory bad faith claim. The court found that plaintiff had failed to state a plausible bad faith

claim because he had not alleged any factual content indicating that State Farm lacked a reasonable

basis for its decision, or that it knew or recklessly disregarded a lack of a reasonable basis. The

plaintiffâ€™s conclusory statements argued only that defendant had â€œunreasonably withheld payment

of underinsured motorist benefits under the policy, failed to make a reasonable offer of settlement,

. . . [and] failed to perform an adequate investigation of the value of his claim.â€? These were the

very type of bare-bones allegations that the Court found insufficient for purposes of stating a

viable, statutory bad faith claim.

         In Kiessling v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., supra., this Court noted that bad faith claims

are fact specific, and that in order to survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must plead specific

facts. 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24085, at *8 (E.D. Pa. 2019). A plaintiff cannot merely say that an

insurer acted unfairly, but must specify what acts were unfair. Id. But allegations that, at their

core, say no more than â€œinsurer negotiated unfairly because it negotiated unfairly,â€? or â€œinsurer

acted in bad faith by acting in bad faith,â€? fall far short of meeting that critical pleading threshold.

         This court has consistently dismissed bad faith counts at the preliminary stage, where, as

here, the Complaint failed to include sufficient factual averments.          See, e.g., Kosmalski v.

Progressive Preferred Ins., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74124 (E.D. Pa. 2018) ("Absent additional

facts regarding Kosmalski's insurance claim and the accompanying investigation, negotiations, or

communications in support of the contention that Progressive's conduct was unreasonable and

reckless, the Court is unable to infer bad faith on the part of Progressive."); Pasqualino v. State

Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69318 (E.D. Pa. 2015) (Motion to dismiss

granted and bad faith claim dismissed).

         The allegations in Plaintiffâ€™s Complaint do not show that she is entitled to relief, with

respect to Count II for alleged Bad Faith. The Complaint does not contain sufficient factual matter

which, if accepted as true, states a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. Plaintiffâ€™s Complaint

contains mere blanket allegations that are simply not actionable under the bad faith statute. Thus,

because the Complaint lacks the necessary facts to meet the Ashcroft/Twombly standard, this Court

should grant the motion and dismiss Count II, with prejudice.

                    PARAGRAPHS 15, 16 AND 17 TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE

                                 pleading, or, if a response is not allowed, within twenty
                                 (20) days after being served with a pleading.

         A decision to grant or deny a motion to strike a pleading, or any part of it, is vested in the

trial court's discretion. Zaloga v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. of Am., 671 F. Supp. 2d 623

(M.D. Pa. 2009). The purpose of a motion to strike such as this one is to clean up the pleadings,

streamline litigation, and avoid unnecessary forays into immaterial matters. Id. The moving party

must establish that the allegations have no possible relation to the controversy, may cause prejudice

to one of the parties, or otherwise confuse the issues that will, ultimately be presented to the finder

of fact. Lane v. McLean, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54033 (M.D. Pa. 2018).

         2.         The Court should strike Paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 to the extent that they are
                    incorporated into Count I of the Complaint.

         Immaterial matter is that which has no essential or important relationship to the claim for

relief. Hoffer v. Grane Ins. Co., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS (M.D. Pa. 2014). Impertinent matter

consists of statements that do not pertain, and are not necessary, to the issues in question. Id.

         Here, Count I of Plaintiffâ€™s Complaint sets forth a claim â€“ in contract â€“ seeking an award

of UIM benefits as a result of her involvement in a motor vehicle accident. Collectively, the

averments set forth in Count I purport to set forth claims for breach of contract/UIM benefits under

the Policy. While Defendant reserves and retains its right to contest and defend against those

allegations of negligence, causation, and extent of damages, it is clear that Plaintiff has set forth a

contract/UIM claim sufficient to survive preliminary challenge.

         However, paragraphs 15, 16 and 17, which are incorporated into Count I, are extraneous

to the contract/UIM claim, and should be stricken from that count. The averments and arguments

encompassed within those paragraphs are neither material nor pertinent to the contract/UIM claim.

They epitomize the immaterial and impertinent matters referenced within Fed. R. Civ. P. No. 12(f),

and they appear there solely to prejudice Defendant, to potentially to expand the very limited scope

of discovery otherwise applicable to a contract claim, and to confuse and conflate the issues that

will be presented to the fact finder. The impertinent and immaterial paragraphs state, in their

entirety:

                    15. Defendant has refused to fairly evaluate Plaintiffs underinsured
                    motorist claim.

                    16. Defendant has refused to make a good-faith settlement offer to
                    resolve Plaintiff's underinsured motorist claim.

                    17. Defendant has made misrepresentations to Plaintiff regarding
                    its evaluation of Plaintiff's underinsured motorist claim.

Doc. 1-5, Â¶Â¶ 15, 16 and 17.

         Count I Plaintiffâ€™s Complaint, however, is a claim for UIM benefits under the Policy. It is

a contract claim, seeking benefits allegedly due to Plaintiff under the terms of the contract - which

in this case is the Liberty Mutual policy. Allegations that Liberty Mutual failed to make good faith

settlement offers, fairly evaluate the claim, or made misrepresentations regarding the evaluation

of the claim, exist solely to unfairly prejudice Liberty Mutual. Including them also implies â€“

improperly and inappropriately â€“ that they are relevant to the issues of causation and extent of

Plaintiffâ€™s alleged accident-related damages. They are not.

         In Stepanovich v. State Farm, No. 1239 WDA, 2013 No. 1296 WDA 2012 (Pa. Super.

October 15, 2013), the Pennsylvania Superior Court explained the issues involved in a UIM claim,

pled as a breach of contract action:

                    Although (plaintiff's) claim for underinsured motorist benefits is
                    labeled as a breach of contractâ€¦ the contract is not technically
                    breached until there has been a determination of liability and an
                    award of damages in excess of the tortfeasor's liability limits. A
                    UIM action represents a disagreement over third-party liability
                    and/or the extent of damages. The insurance contract requires this
                    agreement be resolved through a lawsuitâ€¦

LEGAL/174061944.1




                                                     11
      Case 2:26-cv-00276-MAK             Document 12-1       Filed 01/26/26     Page 12 of 15




         Here, Plaintiffâ€™s allegations relating to Liberty Mutualâ€™s claims handling are immaterial

and impertinent to the issues of third party liability and/or damages. As it pertains to Count I, the

fact finder will not be tasked with assessing pre-suit settlement negotiations or the handling of the

UIM claim; its only instruction will be to return a verdict as to negligence/liability for the

underlying accident, and as to causation, extent, and value of any and all accident-related damages.

         Decisions from Federal District Courts in Pennsylvania have affirmed that, in a claim to

recover UIM coverage, evidence regarding the insurerâ€™s handling of the claim is immaterial and

impertinent. See, e.g., Schwendinger-Roy v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., No. 11-CIV-445

(W.D. Pa. July 10, 2012); Moninghoff v. Tillet, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190896 (E.D. Pa. June 27,

2012); Wagner v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194554 (E.D. Pa. Feb.

20, 2014).

         In Wagner v. State Farm, supra, the court was asked to address whether information

relating to claim handling was relevant to a breach of contract claim to recover UIM benefits. The

question arose in the context of the insured's motion to compel the deposition of the claim adjuster,

but the issues and rationale used by the court to resolve them are applicable here as well. The

court precluded the deposition and held, in part:

                    The Court finds that Defendant has demonstrated good cause for the
                    issuance of a protective order. Plaintiff seeks to depose named
                    personnel to gather information about the evaluation of his UIM
                    claim. However, information about claims handling is not
                    relevant to a breach of contract claimâ€¦ (Emphasis added.)

         In Schwendinger-Roy v. State Farm, supra, the plaintiff filed suit for UIM benefits â€“ a

contract claim like the one at issue here. State Farm filed a motion in limine to preclude evidence

regarding its alleged breach of the insurance contract and improper claims handling. The Court

granted the motion and precluded evidence regarding State Farm's handling of the claim as well
LEGAL/174061944.1




                                                   12
      Case 2:26-cv-00276-MAK             Document 12-1       Filed 01/26/26     Page 13 of 15




as its alleged breach of the insurance contract. Further, the Court explained that the probative

value of revealing State Farm's settlement offer, the amount of available UIM coverage and the

amount of the third party settlement were outweighed by the potential for confusing the issues and

misleading the jury. It is that same potential for confusion that merits the granting of the instant

motion here.

         In Moninghoff v. Tillet, supra, the Court discussed important distinctions between a UIM

claim, requiring an assessment of liability and damages, as compared to an alleged bad faith claim,

implicating the insurer's conduct. The Court held (emphasis added):

                    The Court finds that it makes sense to separate out the UIM claims
                    from the bad faith claims in this matter. The UIM claims require
                    determination of liability and assessment of the plaintiff's
                    injuries. The process that the insurer went through in
                    investigating the plaintiff's claim is not relevant to that issueâ€¦

         Here, Plaintiffâ€™s allegations and inferences in Paragraphs 15, 16 and 17, relating to the

Liberty Mutualâ€™s conduct and claims handling, would only be material and pertinent if they bore

some relevance to the underlying issues of liability, negligence, and/or causation and extent of

damages from the motor vehicle accident. But they donâ€™t.

         Therefore, the allegations included within Paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 are immaterial and

impertinent as it pertains to Count I and should be stricken from that Count pursuant to F.R.C.P.

12(f).

IV.      CONCLUSION

         Defendant, Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company respectfully moves this

Honorable Court to grant its Motion and dismiss Count II (bad faith) of Plaintiffâ€™s complaint and
